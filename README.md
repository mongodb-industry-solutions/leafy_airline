```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const FlightSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  _id: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  dep_time: { type: Date, required: true },
  arr_time: { type: Date, required: true },
  dep_arp: { type: Object, required: true }, // Departure airport details
  arr_arp: { type: Object, required: true }, // Arrival airport details
  airline: { type: String, required: true },
  plane: { type: String, required: true },
  ui_telemetry: { type: Object, required: true }, // UI telemetry data
  flight_number: { type: String, required: true },
  disruption_coords: { type: Object }, // Coordinates related to any disruptions
  initial_path: { type: Array, required: true }, // Initial flight path
  new_path: { type: Array }, // New path in case of re-routing
}, { timestamps: true });

module.exports = mongoose.models.Flight || mongoose.model('Flight', FlightSchema);

```

## Deployment

To deploy this application, GCP's Cloud Run is recommended for its ability to scale containerized applications automatically. Follow the instructions in the [GCP Integration](#gcp-integration) section to set up and deploy your app.

## Integrations

The plane simulation runs due to the application's integrations with GCP services such as Cloud Functions, Vertex AI, and Pub/Sub. Review how you can set up each integration:

### Pub/Sub Topic

### Vertex AI Model

The Vertex AI model is responsible for producing the analytical data required by your application. Follow these steps to train and deploy the model:

1. **Training the Model**:
   - Navigate to the **GCP Console**.
   - Go to **Vertex AI** -> **Colab Enterprise**.
   - Use the notebook available in the repository at `Notebooks/train_cost_calculator` to train and upload the model to the model registry.

2. **Deploying the Model**:
   - Follow the [Vertex AI deployment guide](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/deployment) to deploy the model to an endpoint.
   - Once deployed, the model will be ready to receive input data and provide predictions.

3. **Integrating with Cloud Functions**:
   - Set up a Cloud Function to send input data to the deployed Vertex AI model and receive predictions.
   - The predictions can then be written into a MongoDB collection for further use.

### Cloud Functions

The Cloud Functions are responsible for handling the data flow between your application, Pub/Sub topic, the Vertex AI model, and MongoDB. Follow these steps to configure the Cloud Functions:

#### Cloud Function #1: Data Ingestion and Prediction (Analytical Data Flow)

1. **Create the Cloud Function**:
   - In the **GCP Console** search bar, type `Cloud Run functions`.
   - Click on **Create Function** on the top bar. This will take you to the Configuration page.

2. **Configure the Trigger**:
   - Select **Trigger type** as `Cloud Pub/Sub`.
   - This configuration will trigger the Cloud Function whenever a message is published to the specified Pub/Sub topic.

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Set the following environment variables:
     - `MONGO_DATABASE`
     - `MONGO_COLLECTION`
   - Optionally, add `MONGO_URI` as an environment variable, though it is recommended to store it as a Secret. Follow the [Secret Manager guide](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/configuring/secrets) to create a secret for `MONGO_URI`.

4. **Deploy the Cloud Function**:
   - Click **Next** to proceed to the code section.
   - Choose `Python` as the runtime language.
   - Introduce the code from the repository, found in the `cloud_functions/analyticalDataCF` directory.
       * **Important** : Include both main.py and requirements.txt
   - Click **Deploy** and wait for the function to build and deploy.

Once these steps are completed, your Cloud Function will be able to send data to the Vertex AI model, receive predictions, and store them in a MongoDB collection.

#### Cloud Function #2: Real-time Telemetry data

This service will be in charge of processing real-time continuous data published in the specified Pub/Sub topic. To set it up follow the next steps:

1. **Create the Cloud Function**:
   - In the **GCP Console** search bar, type `Cloud Run functions`.
   - Click on **Create Function** on the top bar. This will take you to the Configuration page.

2. **Configure the Trigger**:
   - Select **Trigger type** as `Cloud Pub/Sub`.
   - This configuration will trigger the Cloud Function whenever a message is published to the specified Pub/Sub topic. (It is important that the topic selection aligns with it's use, not all topics with the same data or same purpose)

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Set the following environment variables:
     - `MONGO_DATABASE`
     - `MONGO_COLLECTION`
   - Optionally, add `MONGO_URI` as an environment variable, though it is recommended to store it as a Secret. Follow the [Secret Manager guide](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/configuring/secrets) to create a secret for `MONGO_URI`.

4. **Deploy the Cloud Function**:
   - Click **Next** to proceed to the code section.
   - Choose `Python` as the runtime language.
   - Introduce the code from the repository, found in the `cloud_functions/telemetryDataCF` directory.
        * **Important** : Include both main.py and requirements.txt
   - Click **Deploy** and wait for the function to build and deploy.

#### Cloud Function #3: Application Data

This service will be in charge of processing application data such as new route and disruption location. This data will only be published in the specified Pub/Sub topic when a change occurs, whilst other topics use a real-time continuous data publishing approach. To set it up follow the next steps:

1. **Create the Cloud Function**:
   - In the **GCP Console** search bar, type `Cloud Run functions`.
   - Click on **Create Function** on the top bar. This will take you to the Configuration page.

2. **Configure the Trigger**:
   - Select **Trigger type** as `Cloud Pub/Sub`.
   - This configuration will trigger the Cloud Function whenever a message is published to the specified Pub/Sub topic (It is important that the topic selection aligns with it's use, not all topics with the same data or same purpose)

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Set the following environment variables:
     - `MONGO_DATABASE`
     - `MONGO_COLLECTION`
   - Optionally, add `MONGO_URI` as an environment variable, though it is recommended to store it as a Secret. Follow the [Secret Manager guide](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/configuring/secrets) to create a secret for `MONGO_URI`.

4. **Deploy the Cloud Function**:
   - Click **Next** to proceed to the code section.
   - Choose `Python` as the runtime language.
   - Introduce the code from the repository, found in the `cloud_functions/applicationDataCF` directory.
